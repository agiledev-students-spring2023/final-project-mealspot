## About Mealspot

Mealspot is an application for planning and budgeting meals for the frugally-minded individual. By tracking costs of each individual meal and grocery item in a single convenient location, Mealspot provides a fast and easy way for people to budget efficiently. Not only does it allow for budget tracking, it also provides a place for users to store grocery lists as a reminder, and it also provides a place to discover and explore new meals in the Mealspot database.

## Product Vision Statement
Mealspot looks to simplify meal planning, making it easy and cost-effective for users to plan meals. With a weekly planner, grocery list, and recipe index, users will have all of the necessary resources in one easy to use app, allowing for a stress-free, budget friendly meal planner for all.

## History

Mealspot was built by college students to deal with one of their primary issues - a lack of money. Since many students face the task of budgeting for the first time in their lives, we had the idea to create an app targeted at solving and simplifying the problem for people like us. Besides budgeting, the task of cooking - one that many college students have to take on first the first time on their own, also came to the forefront, and so we had the idea to focus the budgeting app on food primarily.

## Building and Testing

To run the front-end server from the front-end directory: 
1. Navigate to the front end directory via `cd front-end`
2. Run `npm start` to launch the React.js server

To run the back-end server from the back-end directory: 
1. Navigate to the back end directory via `cd back-end`
2. Run `npm start` to launch the back-end server

To run unit tests for the back-end: `npm test`
